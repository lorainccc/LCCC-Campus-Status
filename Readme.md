# LCCC Campus Status Plugin

The purpose of this plugin is to provide a real-time announcement regarding the status of the Campus.  Mostly this message will be for severe weather closings.

While not a true fork the concept of this plugin was based upon [Roy Sivan](https://www.roysivan.com/)'s [Live Notify Banner](https://github.com/royboy789/live-notify-banner) from [WPCampus 2016](https://2016.wpcampus.org).

The plugin utilizes:
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
    - [AngularFire](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire)
    
The plugin only handles the backend at this time.  The output will be limited to just the homepage of the site, so the output will be handled in the [lorainccc](https://github.com/lorainccc/lorainccc) theme.
